# D3: World of Bits

## Game Design Vision

What this game will encompass by the end will be a mixture of AR games, such as Pokemon Go, and number combination games such as 2048. The game will have the user move around the world in order to locate and combine different peices to create larger and larger combinations of tokens.

## Technologies

- TypeScript for most game code, little to no explicit HTML, and all CSS collected in common `style.css` file
- Deno and Vite for building
- GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages for deployment automation

## Assignments

## D3.a: Core mechanics (token collection and crafting)

Key technical challenge: Can you assemble a map-based user interface using the Leaflet mapping framework?
Key gameplay challenge: Can players collect and craft tokens from nearby locations to finally make one of sufficiently high value?

- [x] delete everything in main.ts
- [x] put a basic leaflet map on the screen
- [ ] draw the player's location on the map
- [ ] draw a rectangle representing one cell on the map
- [ ] use loops to draw a whole grid of cells on the map
